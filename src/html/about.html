            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> I am a passionate and driven college student with a love for programming and PCs . From a young age, I've been fascinated by computers video games. 
                This passion has led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science with a focus on software engineering. 
                I believe in the power of continuous learning and growth, and I am always seeking out new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the ever-evolving field of technology. 
                Whether it's experimenting with different programming languages, tinkering with operating systems or trying to make simple games, I am eager to push myself beyond my comfort zone. 
                These experiences have not only sharpened my technical abilities but have also fostered collaboration, creativity, and effective problem-solving skills. 
                Outside of the digital realm, I enjoy long drives through the great outdoors, playing games, and listening to music. 
                Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase not only my technical skills and projects but also my enthusiasm for innovation, my dedication to excellence, and my commitment to making a positive impact through technology.
                Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!</p>
